#VBA script is attached as a text file. It can be copied/pasted into VBA for testing. 
#I am  unsure as to why my conditional formatting didn't work, and I was unable to get a code to calculate greatest/least percent change to function properly. Any attempts at code froze my computer, so they are not included in the text file. I would be happy to fix both with feedback.
